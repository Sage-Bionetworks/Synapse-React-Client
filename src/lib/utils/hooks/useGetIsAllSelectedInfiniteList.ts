 * Given a list of items and predicates to determine what items are are selected, and which are selectable, return a boolean indicating if all of the entities that can be selected
 * are selected.
 *
 * This function is compatible with react-query's useInfiniteQuery pagination, in which case it's recommended to use the hook version
 * of this function to get updates as pages are fetched and updated.
 *
 * We don't currently support an indeterminate checkbox state because that would require always fetching all pages of a given query, which does not scale.
 * @param items An arbitrary list of items that have already been fetched
 * @param numSelected The number of items that have been selected.
 * @param isSelected A function that takes an item and returns a boolean indicating if that item is selected
 * @param isSelectable A function that takes an item and returns a boolean indicating if that item can be selected
 * @param hasNextPage Whether or not there are additional pages of items (typically supplied by useInfiniteQuery)
 * @param fetchNextPage A function to be invoked to fetch an additional page of items (typically supplied by useInfiniteQuery)
 * @param isFetchingNextPage Indicates if the next page of items is being fetched (typically supplied by useInfiniteQuery)
 * @returns true iff all selectable items have been selected, and there are no additional pages to fetch (because an unfetched page may include an unselected item)
