 * Given a list of entities and a map of which are selected, return a boolean indicating if all of the entities that can be selected

 *
 * This function is compatible with react-query's useInfiniteQuery pagination, in which case it's recommended to use the hook version
 * of this function to get updates as pages are fetched and updated.
 *
 * We don't currently support an indeterminate checkbox state because that would require always fetching all pages of a given query, which does not scale.
 * @param entities An arbitrary list of entities that are displayed
 * @param selected A map where keys are selected entity IDs
 * @param selectableTypes A list of entity types which can be selected. Will be used to filter the list of entities
 * @param hasNextPage Whether or not there are additional pages of entities (typically supplied by useInfiniteQuery)
 * @param fetchNextPage A function to be invoked to fetch an additional page of entities (typically supplied by useInfiniteQuery)
 * @param isFetchingNextPage Indicates if the next page of entities is being fetched (typically supplied by useInfiniteQuery)
 * @returns  true iff all selectable entities have been selected, and there are no additional pages to fetch (because an unfetched page may include an unselected entity)
