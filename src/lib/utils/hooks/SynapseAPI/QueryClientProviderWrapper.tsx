/**
 * To ensure that a component has a QueryClient available via context, you can wrap it in this function.
 *
 * To use react-query's useQuery, each component must have access to the QueryClientProvider context.
 * Since we only export individual components, we may not have the required context. The downside of this strategy
 * is that the component MUST use this supplied QueryClient, and cannot configure their own.
 *
 * We should remove this wrapper if we can ensure that these components will always receive a QueryClient via context
 * in every place they are used (including dependent applications, e.g. Portals and SWC)
