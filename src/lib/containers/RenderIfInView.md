RenderIfInView uses the IntersectionObserver API to allow conditional child rendering and callbacks based on viewport visibility. It will render children when it's scrolled into view.
```js
<RenderIfInView>
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: '#adedba', transition: 'background-color 1s' }}>
      In view
  </div>
</RenderIfInView>
```
