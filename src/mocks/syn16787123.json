We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin. While beyond the scope of the current project, the cNF models developed and validated here may be used in the future to perform automated high throughput 3D drug screenings to identify possible new therapeutic options for NF1 patients.",

The end goal of this effort is to find new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of two primary NF2-related tumors: schwannoma and meningioma. The expectation is to take the work from discovery to pre-clinical development, resulting in the development of an Investigational New Drug (IND) for NF2.

Progress developing nonsurgical therapy for PNs has been limited by a number of factors including 1) the lack of cell culture based models of PN, 2) a limited number of animal models of PN, and 3) limited access of investigators to primary PN tissue from NF1 patients. Although progress is being made in the development and utilization of animal models and cell culture models, the limited availability of primary patient tissue remains a gap. The goal of this project is to establish a biospecimen and xenograft bank from NF1 patients with PN and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and to increase accessibility of these tissues to the research community through a collaboration with the CTF tissue repository.",

Using genetic labeling for cell-lineage tracing, we showed that the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors originate from dorsal spinal nerve roots are the cells of origin for plexiform neurofibromas. Our studies point to the importance of stem cells and their immediate progenitors in the initiation of tumors, consistent with the notion that these neoplasms originate in a subset of primitive precursors and that most cells in an organ do not generate tumors. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion of these DRG/nerve root neurosphere cells (DNSCs), which contain the embryonic GAP43+PLP+ Schwann cell precursors, allow us to reconstruct all the biological steps from the original cells to tumor stage to delineate mechanism of neurofibromagenesis. Most importantly, the ability to isolate embryonic PLP+ GAP43+ cells for ex vivo expansion and Nf1 ablation to generate classic sciatic plexiform neurofibromas provides a reliable and robust non-germline neurofibroma model for in vivo drug screening with a quantifiable and reproducible outcome measure (via bioluminescent scan) to select lead compounds for clinical assessment. In this application, we propose to establish the utility of this non-germline plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) model as a rapid preclinical therapeutic drug screening tool to identify effective therapies for pNF. To achieve this goal, we will first explore the possibility of long term storage of DNSCs to maintain their tumorigenic potential for reliable and rapid plexiform neurofibromagenesis. Next, we will develop it into a robust plexiform neurofibroma model for preclinical drug screening by testing therapeutic effects of different pharmacological interventions.",

To our knowledge, only one prior study (by our group) has examined the effectiveness of a psychological intervention for chronic pain in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with NF1 and PNs. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a type of therapy that focuses on encouraging individuals to engage in more adaptive ways of coping with pain. The goal of ACT is not to eliminate the person's pain, but to optimize the person's functioning despite their pain. This study is examining the impact of an 8-week ACT intervention on pain interference and other variables among AYA ages 16-34 years with NF1, one or more PNs, and chronic pain. We also are exploring the role of heart rate variability (HRV), which is a physiological marker of pain, in this population. The goal of this project is to establish ACT's effectiveness as a psychological intervention tool targeting chronic pain in patients with NF1/PN, in order to improve daily functioning and pain interference. Our primary goal is to compare changes in pain interference scores from pre- to post- intervention between the ACT group and the waitlist (WL) group. Secondary aims include examining baseline to post-treatment changes in quality of life, pain severity, depression, pain-related anxiety, and HRV, assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG); comparing the ACT and WL groups on pre-post changes in quality of life, pain intensity, depression, pain-related anxiety, and HRV; and examining the relationships of HRV with pain and psychosocial variables.",

Therefore, in this application, we propose a set specific aims to fill this knowledge gap: We will define the identity of the cNF cell of origin in mice that will guide us to identify the cells of origin for human cNF. We will next decipher how the cell of origin and the tumor microenvironment contribute to drive cNF initiation that will uncover its pathogenesis to delineate biological steps and mechanisms in tumor development as well as generating of preclinical models system that elucidate cNF biology and enable preclinical therapeutic testing. Our overall project will advance via two parallel but interwoven efforts: (1) Characterize cNF cell of origin to trace their developmental origin as well as to define their phenotypes and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. This will provide a framework for elucidating the functional contributions of cNF cell of origin in neurofibroma development. (2) To determine biological steps that are critical for cNF development. A major innovation in our work is linking these approaches in a synergistic manner to our novel neurofibroma models that can be used broadly to decipher the pathogenesis as well as pre-clinical models for therapeutic testing.",

We will do this by first deconstructing human cNFs through single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-Seq) to rigorously define the cell populations and sub-populations in these complex tumors. We will then develop three-dimensional (3D) co-culture models of these tumors as a step toward pathomimetic systems for more accurate preclinical therapeutic screening.The goal of the first aim is to use scRNA-Seq to develop an unbiased portrait of the cellular composition of NF1 cNFs. Each tumor that is deconstructed will be a milestone along the way to reaching that goal. We anticipate that at least 8 tumors will need to be deconstructed to take account of the high degree of heterogeneity in the these tumors. Approximately 10,000 cells from each sample will be subject to scRNA-Seq, with the rest used for development of primary cNF cells and fibroblasts for use in Aim Two. The second aim has the goal of development of pathomimetic avatars of NF1 cNFs that will be useful for therapeutic testing. The number and complexity of the avatars required will be determined by the results of the scRNA-Seq. Milestones will be successful development of 3D culture and co-culture conditions for the cell types and of quantitative assays for their morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis.",

PROs meeting FDA guidelines are critical to ensuring patient-centered endpoints are incorporated. Historically, NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (pNF) treatment trials have under-utilized PROs specific to pNF. A psychometrically sound measure incorporating input from patients, families and clinicians, is critical for inclusion in treatment trials. To address the need for a pNF-specific PRO measure for use in clinical trials, this project sought to develop a PRO measurement system utilizing input from patients, families and clinicians, as well as well as psychometric analysis methods to ensure the developed measures are reliable and valid. Specifically this project designed a PRO system for children and young adults with pNF by (1) establishing a conceptual model describing HRQOL, 2) Developing item pools (e.g., pain, stigma, and organ dysfucntion measures), 3) Evaluating psychometric properties of the pools, 4) affirming clinical differences.",

Hence, creating a cell culture initiative was an early priority. While current animal models can faithfully mimic some aspects of pNF (tumor histology, imaging characteristics, natural history), they are based on relatively narrow genetically engineered platforms and are not fully representative of human NF1 diversity. Moreover, the tumors in these models are slow growing (requiring 9-12 months for a single compound efficacy study) and costly. Hence, there is a need for in vivo models that allow more rapid drug screening (particularly when considering possible combinatorial therapies) and a need for in vitro models that allow more facile manipulation of the NF1 gene in order to understand the molecular genomics influencing tumor behavior. The goal of this project is to create a panel of cell culture systems that represent pNF complexity and can be utilized to both screen new compounds as well as to identify new therapeutic targets.",

Extensive analysis has shown that from a genetic and genomic perspective, there is no additional recurrent genetic alteration besides the NF1 inactivation involved in cNFs. Despite its simple genetic etiology, the contribution of the interactions among cells composing cNFs need to be investigated to better understand their role in cNF formation and their potential influence on treatment response. In this work, we propose to use co-cultures of cNF-derived primary SCs and FBs to identify expression signatures in cNFs that are specifically due to SC-FB heterotypic interactions. For this purpose we will compare RNA-Seq data from cNFs, their single cell primary cultures and co-cultures of SCs and FBs. Furthermore, we will identify the genetic variation present in gene coding regions of neurofibroma donors. Since SCs and FBs used in co-cultures will belong to different individuals, we estimate to dissect about 75% of the expression signature due to SC-FB interactions by assigning each differently expressed gene to a specific cell type, according to their genetic variation. Signaling pathways represented by expression signatures will be analyzed and their disruption tested functionally. The goal of this study is to understand the signaling between SCs and FBs within cNFs and their importance and impact on their viability, proliferation capacity and contribution to cNF development.",

Collins Scholarship examines two innovative and non-invasive measures of tissue microstructure: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance technique to quantify white matter tracts and assess tract damage by measuring the preferential motion of water molecules along and not across hydrophobic myelin. In preliminary data, measures of white matter integrity in the optic radiations of children with OPG are associated with current visual acuity and may predict visual acuity one year later. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) uses pseudo-randomized magnetic resonance acquisition parameters and a matching algorithm to rapidly quantify T1, T2, M0 and off-resonance signals.

While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons accelerate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens. To identify these potentially clinically-actionable mitogens, we have designed a series of milestone-driven experiments using a novel collection of patient-derived and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring NF1-patient germline NF1 gene mutations.",

Immune surveillance could be expected to recognize neurofibromin neoepitopes resulting from the second hit of the NF1 gene, but this is not taking place in cNFs. Mast cells are known to be abundant in cNFs and they are increasingly more interesting as druggable targets in tumor biology and neurogenic itch. It is also not known whether mast cells of cNFs are tumorigenic or anti- tumorigenic. The goal of this project is to prove that T cells and mast cells are valid targets for the treatment of cNF.

Recent advances in mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics permit the determination of the extent, localization, and site-specific stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation. We propose using two complementary MS-based approaches to define (i) the proteome and phosphoproteome and (ii) the activated kinome signature of NF1-deficient Schwann cells (SCs). We will perform analyses on a panel of SC lines derived from PNs. Transcriptome profiling of cell lines will complement these data sets, together providing a detailed view of the cellular signaling networks and the molecular targets controlled by neurofibromin in a cell-type relevant to the disease. Finally, we will use small molecule inhibitors to both known and any novel signaling pathways we identify to examine the adaptive kinome in treated cell lines. Combining the use of a novel panel of cell lines with the sensitivity of high-end MS, we expect to identify signaling pathways and targets previously implicated as being important in NF1-associated tumors, as well as new and unexpected targets downstream of NF1.",

Moreover, the genomic mechanisms responsible for dermal tumor proliferation are not completely understood, although biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene is known to be required. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, which negatively regulates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade that includes the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pro-growth pathways. Current therapeutic development for NF1-related tumors target components of this pathway; however, clinical trials directed at dermal neurofibromas have been hampered by the difficulty in measuring and counting dermal neurofibromas. The overall goal of this project is to complete a longitudinal natural history study of dermal neurofibromas to enhance current knowledge of dermal neurofibroma development as well as improve the design, implementation, and interpretation of clinical trials targeting DNs. To address the clinical trial facet of this project, a trial using the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib will be piloted. We will also evaluate the quality of life impact of dermal neurofibromas before and during Selumetinib treatment. For both facets of this study, we will examine genomic alterations that correlate with DN development and selumetinib response.",

The aims of Project 1 are: Aim 1: Evaluate tumor and circulating markers before and after treatment with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in pediatric and adult patients with NF1 associated plexiform neurofibromas. Aim 2: Evaluate the molecular adaptive responses, PK/PD and clinical response of plexiform neurofibromas in genetically engineered mice (GEM) with selumetinib alone, and in combination with imatinib mesylate.

SMNs are a fundamental problem in cancer survivors. Compelling data generated by Drs. Nakamura and Shannon in GEM mice demonstrated that irradiation cooperates strongly with heterozygous Nf1 inactivation in the development of a spectrum of SMNs that recapitulate common SMNs in human patients with and without NF1. Project 4 will translate these novel data and will systematically assess the incidence of SMNs in NF1 patients and examine associated risk factors such as age at diagnosis, anatomic site of the primary tumor, and dose and duration of prior treatment. Data compiled by the NCI-funded Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) will play an integral role in Project 4. The aims of Project 4 are: Aim 1. To describe the magnitude of risk of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in individuals with NF1. Aim 2. To perform comparative oncogenomics to identify genetic alterations associated with radiation-induced tumorigenesis in individuals with NF1. Aim 3. To validate in model systems the biologic importance of candidate pathways in radiation-induced tumorigenesis and to determine whether radiotherapy promotes transformation of plexiform neurofibromas to MPNSTs in vivo. The translational impact of this work involves informing current clinical practice in the treatment of tumors arising in NF1 patients to reduce the risk of SMN, and generating insights into the underlying biology of SMN that will lead to new therapies for these common, aggressive, and largely refractory cancers.",

While the clinical aspects of NF1 are well characterized and the pathogenesis of plexiform neurofibromas has been widely studied, surprisingly little is known about the genetic and epigenetic changes in the NF1 mutant glioma. This has hindered the development of effective therapies for NF1-mutant cancers. To address this challenge and uncover the driver genes in NF1-glioma, The team will analyze whole-exome and transcriptome data from glioma samples of pediatric and adult NF1 patients. Alterations in the genetic networks will be contextualized in the natural genetic and cellular environment of a specific tumor, and the key driving modules on which specific NF1-glioma subgroups rely for growth, survival and progression will be identified. With this information in hand, we can target the critical alterations with specific drugs, often already available for other types of diseases. The specific aims are to (1) comprehensively characterize the genomic and epigenetic landscape of NF1 gliomas from patients of all age groups, (2) identify driver genetic alterations in NF1-gliomas from the integration of somatic copy number variations, mutations and gene fusions (translocations), (3) reconstruct a somatic alteration network for the inference of mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of genetic aberrations in NF1-gliomas and (4) validate the functional significance of the inferred alterations in neural systems in vitro and in vivo, and target therapeutically key genetic nodes with highly specific inhibitors.",

As benign tumors, PNFs are likely to be more dependent on factors in the microenvironment, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM) and paracrine growth factors, compared to malignant tumors. It is now clear that many cell types grow better in three-dimensional cultures than on two-dimensional growth surfaces, and it may be that PNFs will growth more robustly in a system that mimics their in vivo growth patterns. The goal of this project is to determine the optimum ECM substrate for nf1 null Schwann cell growth, and to develop a pNF culture system to be used in 96-well based assays (preclinical screening applications). The main goal is to improve the culture conditions for PNF cells, so that these benign tumors can be more reliably cultured from primary tumors. Our secondary goal is to develop culture conditions that lead to PNF gene expression that most closely mimics PNF cells in primary tumors. By developing faithful culture conditions, PNF cells can be tested in drug screen assays with more accurate cell responses to compounds being tested.",

They can occur in the setting of type I neurofibromatosis (NF1-associated), or sporadically or in association with prior radiotherapy (RT-associated). Using comprehensive genomic approaches, we and others have discovered that the majority of MPNSTs have inactivation of three tumor suppressor pathways, including the NF1, the CDKN2A (INK4A/ARF) and the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) pathways. Here, we propose to use multidisciplinary approaches to establish authentic MPNST model systems for preclinical investigation. We will also evaluate a combination treatment strategy of trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) and ribociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) in various cell line and animal models of MPNST. Lastly, we will conduct a screen using RNA interference technology to identify and characterize the genes that are important for MPNST growth and survival when the PRC2 pathway is inactivated. These studies will build important resources for the NF1-research community and can identify novel treatment strategies and streamline clinical therapeutic development for patients with NF1-associated MPNSTs.",

MPNSTs develop tumor hypoxia and necrosis as a pathophysiologic consequence of structurally and functionally disturbed microcirculation. Although tumor hypoxia is strongly associated with tumor propagation and treatment resistance, it also offers the perfect niche for the growth of the \"therapeutic\" anaerobic spore-forming bacterium Clostridium novyi-NT (C. novyi-NT). C. novyi-NT's oncolytic potential has been successfully used to treat a variety of solid cancers. Once injected, C. novyi-NT spores germinate in tumor hypoxia while vegetative bacteria cannot survive in normoxia and sporulate. We recently demonstrated robust and reproducible antitumor responses when C. novyi-NT spores were injected into dogs with spontaneous peripheral nerve sheath tumors and in human patients with therapy resistant sarcomas (NCT01924689). The goal of this project is to explore C. novyi-NT as a novel therapeutic for NF1-associated MPNSTs (gather preclinical evidence substantiating clinical trial for for C. novyi-NT therapy in NF1 patients with MPNSTs)",

The SC genes that are deregulated in mouse and human neurofibromas have not been fully identified. Many cell types are present in neurofibromas besides SCs. These include fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells that are NF1 wild type (as in solitary neurofibroma or in somatic mosaic patients) or NF1 heterozygous (as in many NF1 patients and some mouse models). But how these cells and the intercellular communications contribute to plexiform neurofibroma growth is unknown. It has been recently identified that macrophage is a major cell type in neurofibromas. Macrophages shift gene expression and function in response to the environment, including after nerve injury. Macrophages show anti- tumor effects by secreting free-radicals and recruiting the adaptive immune system (primarily T-cells). However as tumors progress, macrophages stimulate tumor growth and blood vessel formation. Injury-associated inflammation facilitates neurofibroma development by recruiting macrophages in mouse models. How these inter- and intra-cellular interactions contribute to neurofibroma formation has not been studied yet. The goals of this project are to characterize gene expression profiles of Schwann cells and macrophages in mouse nerves and neurofibromas, identify cytokine/chemokine pathways that slow or promote tumor growth and identify molecular networks that mediate intra- and inter-cellular signaling in controlling neurofibroma growth.",

In comparison to 2D cultures, cells growing in a 3-dimensional (3D) matrix that models the (patho) physiological environment typically: 1) adopt a morphology that better recapitulates that in vivo; 2) exhibit slower growth more akin to those in vivo; and 3) demonstrate drug sensitivity and resistance that may better reflect potential therapeutic response. Our goals were to develop and optimize robust 3D co-culture models of NF1 PNs to allow preclinical drug screening that is both much more representative of likely translational effectiveness than provided by testing in 2D mono-culture, and at a much higher throughput than is available in animal models. Further, we predict that programs such as the NF Clinical Trials Consortium are more likely to be successful if they build on data from robust and representative pre-clinical models. Our aims were therefore to: 1. Develop, characterize and optimize 3D co-culture models to include the cell types found in NF1 PNs; and 2. Test potential drugs in the 3D models of NF1 PNs, with a focus on candidates chosen for translational potential.",

This involves, among other things, being able to use large quantities of NF1(+/-) and (-/-) cells closely resembling cells driving PNF formation and growth. PNF-derived NF1(+/-) and (-/-) iPS cells have been generated and can be used to test differentiation protocols towards the Neural Crest (NC) -Schwann cell (SC) lineage. Differentiated cells at different points of this lineage commitment can be characterized and engrafted into the sciatic nerve of nude mice to test their tumor-formation capacity and, in this way, interrogate about the identity of the cells originating PNFs. Two things, the setting up the right in vitro iPSC differentiation conditions towards NC and SC in one side and on the other, the characterization of the different steps of differentiation in the NC-SC lineage, will proportionate the basis for performing future drug screenings for PNFs using iPSC-derived cells. The goals of this project are to (1) set up in vitro conditions to efficiently differentiate iPS cells into cells of the Neural Crest -Schwann cell lineage. Characterize the methylome and transcriptome of these cells with distinct NF1 genotypes and test their potential engraftment/tumor formation capacity. (2) Generate new iPSC and edit control iPSC with distinct NF1 genotypes to interrogate the presence of epigenetic memory in the PNF-derived iPS cells generated",

Regarding genomics and transcriptomics, Schwann cells (SC) derived from dNFs and pNFs are very much alike. So what is different among these tumors that confer pNFs a risk to become malignant?

                        "One of the most common malignancies affecting adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), highly aggressive sarcomas that typically develop from benign plexiform neurofibromas. 8-13% of individuals with NF1 will develop MPNSTs during young adulthood. There are few therapeutic options, and the vast majority of people with these cancers will die within 5 years of diagnosis. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of these tumors and the identification of seemingly-promising therapeutic targets using a single mouse MPNST model system (NPCis mice and derivative cell lines), no investigational agents have demonstrated efficacy following translation to human clinical trials. However, there is limited genetic diversity being modeled in these systems, which does not capture the full spectrum of genetic diversity that characterizes human NF1-MPNSTs. In this regard, p53 loss, a common feature of the currently-used preclinical models, is observed in a minority of human MPNSTs. We hypothesize that one of the major reasons that rationally-chosen drugs underperform in human clinical trials is that the preclinical models used to discover and evaluate promising therapeutic agents do not capture the genetic heterogeneity of the human cancer. To optimize clinical translation, we aim to develop a collection of MPNST Patient Derived Xenografts (MPNST-PDXs) for the NF community, which more fully represent the spectrum of genetic heterogeneity seen in the human condition. The main goal of this research project is to develop a set of NF1-MPNST PDX lines that captures the spectrum of molecular heterogeneity of the human disease. The proposal aims to meet the following objectives: a. Create enabling resources including 10 NF1-MPNST PDX lines for preclinical studies. b. Histologically and genomically characterize these 10 NF1-MPNST PDX lines, thereby defining the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors. c. Determine whether there is a correlation between molecular subtype and response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy. d. Assess potential adaptive mechanisms or tumor resistance by assessing genomic changes following treatment.",

My preliminary data, using an NF1-deficient mouse model, indicates that there are two critical steps that need to take place in order for optic pathway gliomas to form. The first step occurs early during optic nerve development, occurring before 21 days of life. The second step involves immune cell infiltration, and thus swelling of the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells (which results in vision loss). This second step occurs around 60 days of life, and continues to progress as the mouse ages.

This is of great clinical need as there is no consistent method to differentiate neurofibromas and MPNSTs pathologically. GCPII is selectively expressed on non-myelinating Schwann cells in the PNS (Berger, Luthi-Carter et al. 1999), which is thought to be the cell of origin for neurofibroma tumor development. Recent (unpublished data) demonstrated that small molecule GCPII inhibitors could enhance Schwann cell-mediated myelination both in vitro and in vivo, possibly by inducing non-myelinating Schwann cells to differentiate into a myelinating phenotype. By extension, it was considered conceivable that GCPII inhibition could limit the non-myelinating Schwann cell proliferation that occurs in neurofibromas by inducing the Schwann cells into a differentiated phenotype. The goals of this project are to evaluate (1) the Schwann cell enzyme Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) as a potential diagnostic marker to distinguish between malignant and benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and (2) the potential therapeutic effect of inhibiting GCPII enzymatic activity on the growth of neurofibroma tumors in animal models.",

We have recently shown that the neural crest derived boundary cap (BC) cells, transiently present at the interface between central and peripheral nervous system in a mouse embryo, migrate sequentially along nerve roots and along peripheral nerves under the skin, two locations where NFs develop with a higher incidence in NF1 patients. Furthermore, in the adult skin, BC derivatives correspond to various types of Schwann cells and dermal stem cells with gliogenic potential, two cell populations considered as the primary pathogenic target of NF1. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that BCs could be directly implicated in the development NFs. To explore such possibility, we have generated mouse line carrying NF1 loss combined with fluorescent tracer in BC cells and their derivatives. All mutant mice develop both paraspinal plexiform and cutaneous NFs whose location and cellular composition faithfully recapitulates NFs present in human NF1 patients.The aim of this study is to take advantage of this unique model and our extensive expertise of NF1 pathology and of mechanisms governing the development of Schwann cells to tackle three important issues concerning the initiation and progression, cellular origin and novel treatment of cNFs.",

Genotype-phenotype correlations have thus far been unsuccessful at predicting which patients will develop what features. The only exception is patients carrying an NF1 microdeletion. These patients have a uniform germline deletion of 1.4Mb containing 14 genes, including NF1 and have a more severe phenotype. The vast majority of microdeletion patients present themselves with >1000 cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas. They are at increased risk for the development of plexiform neurofibromas (76% vs 43-50%) and have a 4-fold increase in lifetime risk for MPNSTs (up to 50%); tumors also arise at a younger age. As a consequence NF1 microdeletion patients are followed up more rigorously and any complaint of pain or growing tumors is seldom ignored. NF1 microdeletion patients would benefit tremendously from the development of therapies that would prevent the onset MPNSTs and by inference of plexiform neurofibromas. In this patient group the benefits would outweigh the risk of conducting a prevention trial. The goals of this project are to determine if BRD4 inhibitors can prevent or delay the onset of tumors in a mouse model for MPNST development in NF1 microdeletion patients (NPS mice) and if the treatment with BRD4 inhibitors alters the recruitment of immune cells to tumor initiation sites. Specifically we ask if there is an enhanced recruitment of anti-tumor immune cells, like cytotoxic T-cells, or a reduction in immune suppressive myeloid cells.",

CNFs account for substantial morbidity and disfigurement in NF1. Unlike plexiform neurofibromas, which are congenital lesions, CNFs manifest during adolescence suggesting that their pathogenesis is influenced by environmental or hormonal factors. CNFs are comprised of a confederacy of cell types with distinct embryonic lineages, including Schwann-like cells, perineural cells (neural crest or neuro-ectoderm), fibroblasts (mesoderm), and mast cells (bone marrow-derived). The goal of this project is to develop new therapy strategies for peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Cutaneous Neurofibromas (CNFs) and Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs).",

These studies identified that direct injection of the AAV product into the sciatic schwannoma lead to the regression of well-established tumors and importantly, prevented new tumors from developing (Prabhaka et al., 2013, Human Gene Therapy). Utilizing a similar concept and in collaboration with Dr. Breakefield, we will test the efficacy of AAV serotypes and its associated control serotype in preventing (as well as reducing) existing tumor volume and number in our Nf1 plexiform neurofibroma mouse model.  Angiogenesis plays a major role in tumor development, growth, and invasion of nearby cells, wherein endoglin is expressed on tumor vessels and is essential for angiogenesis. We hypothesize that inhibition of the endoglin pathway as well as the VEGF pathway in a combinatory therapeutic setting using our Nf1 tumor bearing mouse model will provide signification tumor reduction of plexiform neurofibromas.  Neurofibromas are complex tumors composed of Schwann cells, mast cells, fibroblasts and perineurial cells embedded in collagen that provide a lattice for tumor invasion. Fibroblasts are a major cellular constituent in neurofibromas and are a source of collagen that constitutes ~50% of the dry weight of the tumor. Work performed in our lab has shown that two of the prevalent heterozygous cells found in neurofibromas, mast cells and fibroblasts interact directly to contribute to the tumorigenic phenotype. Nf1+/- mast cells secrete elevated concentrations of the profibrotic transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We will conduct studies exploring a TGF-beta inhibitor, as we foresee this as a potential drug target that could be accelerated to in human testing if successful in our preclinical work.  Goals of Project: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of various AAV serotypes, a TGF- beta inhibitor, a VEGF inhibitor and a VEGFR inhibitor against existing plexiform neurofibromas utilizing a novel genetically engineered mouse model of plexiform neurofibroma.",

Such screens are conducted with an array of molecules (panels of oncology drugs, drugs for other indications, and compounds with possibly unknown bioactivity), ultimately measuring a biological change within a disease model. While these screens can yield valuable hits, they also present the challenge of identifying the target(s) that mediate the effect seen in the screen for several reasons. For example, many drugs have a polypharmacologic target profile making it hard to identify which targets are biologically relevant for a given drug. Furthermore, some libraries contain molecules for which drug-target studies have never been conducted. To address these challenges, we developed an application that enables exploration of the chemical-biological interaction space. Drug-target interaction data from ChEMBL (CC BY-SA 3.0), ChemicalProbes.org (CC BY-SA 3.0), DGIdb (open), DrugBank (CC BY-NC 4.0, used with approval), and Klaeger, et al, 2017 was collected for over 280,000 molecules. In addition, when quantitative data were obtained, pChEMBL values were calculated. Each molecule was annotated with a name and chemical structure, and every target was annotated with protein & gene identifiers. An interactive web interface was developed using the R Shiny platform and cheminformatics R packages.",

Currently, no valid PRO measures exist that assess PN-related pain and its effect on daily functioning. The first phase of this limited-site study is to modify existing PRO pain tools using qualitative methods to ensure understanding of the concepts being assessed and to examine how the current tools work in the NF1/PN population. The second phase is to examine the psychometric properties of the modified PROs in individuals with NF1 and PNs.

These observations suggest the possibility that hyperactive ERK might target TRAP1 in mitochondria of PN cells, thus leading to succinate-dependent, pro-neoplastic HIF-1 activation. This project aims at investigating the possibility that hyperactive Ras/ERK signalling could contribute to pro-neoplastic metabolic rearrangements in mitochondria of neurofibroma cells by regulating TRAP1 chaperone activity, thus crucially contributing to the processes of growth and malignant transformation of PNs. We will dissect the mode of action of TRAP1, connecting it with the metabolic status of PNs and MPNSTs, which will be thoroughly investigated in in vivo tumor models.",

The Lee and Kim labs have been working on genetic editing in human pluripotent stem cells for over three years and have generated many 'knock-in' and 'knock-out' lines. After verification of the gene targeting and pluripotency of the selected clones, established NF1-/SMASh hESC clones will be subjected to our Schwann cell specification protocol. We will treat cells with the asunaprevir (ASv) chemical compound at different time points to assess any cellular and molecular changes, either in intact cells or isolated populations (SOX10::GFP+ neural crest cells, CD49d+ Schwann cell precursors and EGFR+ Schwann cells). The goal of this project is to generate a viable human Schwann cell model for cNF and identify differences in susceptibility to NF1 loss in different stages of Schwann cell development.
